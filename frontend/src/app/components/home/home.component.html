                 Matcher want to show to users and companies. This application allows 
                 to calculate a compatibility factor of the cultural values a person and a job, 
                 compatibility factor of the cultural, improving the selection process of the business.

            <p>
                After we have obtained the user and job cultural profiles we consider the polygons generated by 
                the radar plots of them. Then, we use Montecarlo 
                mthods to calculate the area of the union and the intersection of these polygons.
                Finally, whe calculate the ratio of the union and intersection areas 
                to provide you a compatibility factor of the cultural profile of your job and the candidate
                 you are evaluting.
